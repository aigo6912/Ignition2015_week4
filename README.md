## Intro to RSpec and testing

#### Week 4: Diving into Rails
##### Required
- Read the [Web Refresher](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/a-railsy-web-refresher) from the Odin project.
- Read an [Intro to RSpec](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/an-introduction-to-rspec) to better understand testing
- Skim through [Hartl rails tutorial chapter 1](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning). We have covered most of this already, but there are some great sections that go in depth with Unix commands, explaining the purpose and structure of Rails, Git commands, and several other concepts that are worthwhile to review. 
- Complete [CH 3](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/static_pages) and [CH 4](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/rails_flavored_ruby) of the Hartl rails tutorial, individually.
- They use Bitbucket, please use GitHub instead. 
- Once your teammate has completed CH 3 and 4 of the tutorial, pull down their project and run it within Cloud9 to verify that it works correctly.  
- Also, run the tests to make sure they are green (we will be checking this). 
- Modify the homepage to include a line that says `verified by: YOUR NAME` in the footer.

##### Optional
- Read the [Hartl rails tutorial chapter 2](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/toy_app) to get an inside look at building another application, similar to what you did last week.
- Code School [Testing with RSpec](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/testing-with-rspec)
